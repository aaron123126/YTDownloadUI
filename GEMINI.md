Project ToDos:
- None (Core features implemented).

Overall Project Goal:
To create a nice, interactive CLI/TUI for the python module yt-dlp, with features like navigation, animations, progress bars, and many settings. The UI should be visually appealing with colors, menus, and rounded corners, built using Node.js.

Other Notes.
Current Project Status:
- Initial project setup complete with `package.json`, `node_modules`, and `index.js`.
- **UI/UX Refactor (Major Change):**
    - New panel-based layout: Left panel for main menu, right panel for dynamic content, smaller global log at the bottom.
    - Dedicated floating status overlay for active operations (download/seeding progress).
    - Navigation changed from Tab to Arrow Keys for menu selection.
    - `index.js` refactored to manage the new layout and global status components.
- Download functionality integrated using `yt-dlp` as a child process, now rendering within the content panel and updating the global log and status overlay.
- Settings module (`settings.js`) adapted to render its UI within the content panel and use the global log.
- Torrenting feature implemented:
    - Added "Torrent" option to the main menu.
    - `torrent.js` module created for torrent operations, adapted to render its UI within the content panel and use the global log and status overlay.
    - UI for torrent operations includes a file path input, a browse button using `blessed.filemanager` for file/directory selection, and a "Create and Seed Torrent" button.
    - Dynamic import of `webtorrent` implemented in `torrent.js` to resolve `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`.
    - Real-time seeding progress (upload speed, peers) displayed in a dedicated status box within the torrent UI and reflected in the global status overlay.
- Comprehensive `README.md` created and updated to reflect all features.
